## 🧠 Project Overview

The Sensory Learning Companion is a multimodal learning system developed to improve educational accessibility for learners with diverse sensory needs. The platform integrates visual, auditory, and interactive components to enhance comprehension, engagement, and retention.

The system is designed with a strong focus on usability, inclusivity, and real world applicability in modern educational environments.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a modular client server architecture.

* The **frontend** handles user interaction, learning interfaces, and accessibility features.
* The **backend** manages authentication, content processing, learning logic, and API services.
* The **database** stores user data, learning content, progress tracking, and analytics.

All components communicate through secure RESTful APIs to ensure scalability and maintainability.

### Frontend

* Framework: React / Next.js
* Styling: Tailwind CSS
* State Management: Context API / Redux

### Backend

* Runtime: Node.js
* Framework: Express.js / FastAPI
* API Style: REST
* Authentication: JWT based authentication

### Database

* Database Type: MongoDB
* Data Handling: Mongoose ORM

### Other Tools

* Version Control: Git and GitHub
* Deployment: Vercel / Render
* Libraries and Services:

  * OCR and image processing
  * Speech or audio processing tools
  * Accessibility focused UI libraries
